	<h1>No-Privacy for humans only</h1>
	<h2>on the 16th of december 2006, by Larry</h2>
	<p>
	    Everything I know about studivz sounds like some serious fun, girls, boys, registered to no privacy Inc. That is organized gang rape, if there is such thing. 
	</p>
	<p>
	    Still, one thing kept me sleepless for weeks: animal cannot register.
	    fickzoo.com will do better, I promise. unlimited online animal dating, free for all!
	</p>

	<h1>fickzoo.com loves horses too</h1>
	<h2>on the 5th of december 2006, by Larry</h2>
	<p>
	    Riding can be fun, but still for most people there is more
	    to it. It is passion.
	    Passion that gives rise to a somewhat more intense relationship
	    to your horse.
	    Due to legal issues I cannot talk openly here, but there are
	    people in this world who have the guts to do so.
	    Above all that is Germany's biggest and filthiest TV
	    channel, RTL.
	    To our all bliss they set up ApassionatA, a show touring
	    whole Europe celebrating animal love.
	    Some quotes from the website should give you a good idea
	    about what animal fans can expect.
	</p>
	<p>
	    "... verspielt wie eine Frühlingsbrise, heißblütig wie eine Sommernacht, stürmisch wie der Herbst ..."
	</p>
	<p>
	    "Mit über vierzig erlesenen Rassehengsten und den herausragendsten Reitmeistern der Gegenwart ..."
	</p>
	<p>
	    These quotes are in german and as most of us dont speak the language of feces country, I asked 
	    the babelfish to translate it:
	</p>
	<p>
	    "... playful like a Fruehlingsbrise, heissbluetig like one sommernacht, stormily like the autumn ..."
	</p>
	<p>
	    "Also over forty Rassehengsten and the most outstanding riding masters of the present erlesenen ..."
	</p>
	<p>
	    Those translators still do suck, but I guess we all got the
	    idea. If those germans are <b>not</b> talking sex there, I
	    listen to 80s disco for 2 weeks.

	<h1>fickzoo.com takes over SONY BMG</h1>
	<h2>on the 24th of september 2006, by Larry</h2>
	<p>
	    My beloved friends from the zoo
	</p>

	<p>
	    I feel quite safe dealing with you in this miraculous proposition
	    because I trust in your good taste and economic sanity. Once again since
	    the foundation of fickzoo.com we will be the setters of yet another
	    trend. The overall worthiness of SONY BMG right now is approximately 1.5
	    billion euro. One share is right now at the price of 32 euros. If only
	    30 million people would buy one share, they would have more than 50
	    percent of SONY BMG. So basically the plan is to make other people buy
	    market shares of SONY BMG. sounds like I have some intrests in making
	    the price rocketing? aww
	</p>
	<p>
	    sign my <a href="http://www.pledgebank.com/SONYBMGtakeover">pledge</a> now!!
	</p>
	<p>
	    You can do it! Dont be economic girlyman!

	    Our community has been struck by a great ball of new kink:
	    <i>Food Dangling</i>. The idea is to, well, dangle food.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Always keep in mind that most of the Food Danglers think
	    that only perverts dangle something other than food, or with
	    some tool other than the mouth.
	</p>
	<p>
	    For you to get the picture: some pictures.

	<h1>A community speaks up</h1>
	<h2>on the 1st of july, 2006 by John</h2>
	<p>
	    We are here finally. We have spent years of cowardly hiding from
	    the public, chased by chrisitians, republicans and even the most
	    liberal democrats out there in the wild.<br />
	    We had to lie to our neighbours, friends, families, even our wifes
	    and children.<br />
	    We had to make up stories about our week-long travels to
	    foreign countries and continents, fake some holiday photos,
	    steal towels from hotels we were never even close to.
	</p>
	<p>
	    That is over now. In a weird night we decided we need a
	    lobby. Nobody speaks for us, so we have to do it ourselves.
	    And here we are. Your &quot;nice guy&quot; neighbours,
	    colleagues, relatives, the average <i>animal lover</i>.<br />
	    Yes, animal lover. We love animals. Everybody likes animals,
	    is pleased to have dogs or cats around him, our children
	    like watching penguins or elephants in <i>zoos</i> or
	    <i>safari parks</i>.<br />
	    We <i>love</i> them. And they <i>love</i> us. It is an <i>us</i> 
	    and <i>them</i> thing, not an <i>S</i> and <i>M</i> thing. 
	</p>
	<p>
	    Now what we plan to do here on <b>fickzoo.com</b> is giving
	    the world an insight into the animal loving community. We will
	    show you that we are not any weirder than you are, especially
	    as in these times kinky is the new normal. We will just tell
	    you the <i>truth</i> here, in <i>blogs</i>, <i>stories</i>,
	    <i>articles</i> and probably even some <i>games</i>. We will
	    tell you who we are and what we do. Nobody needs to be
	    scared of us, least the animals.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Of course, and even those moralists wishing us dead know
	    that and will agree, we cannot provide <i>evidence</i>, as in most
	    states and countries throughout the world our community is
	    chased and harassed. What we will try to do is <i>telling
	    you the truth without providing evidence</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
	    As of now, we are in process of building up fickzoo.com,
	    there will be more content here week by week. I am happy you
	    have read on until here, that probably means you can be convinced
	    to drop your intolerant feelings against me and my people,
	    so I would be glad if you came back in a few weeks and see
	    what has happened here by then.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Sincerely yours,<br />
	    <b><i>John Fickzoo</i></b>
