Changes since 0.1rc1
 Bugfixes
  - Cleaned up the code to not make any cyclic references which 
    would make the garbage colector run often and long in high
    load environments. Also disconnected sessions are now cleaned
    immediately.
  - Fixed a bug in the code using the mootools accordion. Removing
    panes now actually works properly.
  -

    offline and idle users.
  - New messages now trigger a sound, if not deactivated.
