Installation
	Installation instructions can be found on the homepage.

	To run YakityChat, the lib/ directory needs to be in the
	pike module path when running roxen. The file modules/yakitychat.pike
	is the roxen module and it needs to be placed in the roxen
	module directories. You have to restart roxen after taking care of
	that. 

	It should then be simply to add the YakityChat module to one
	of the sites. The htdocs/ directory then needs to be made available
	in you website using a normal filesystem module.


	More detailed instructions are available on our website at
